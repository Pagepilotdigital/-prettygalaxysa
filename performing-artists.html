      <h2>Makeup for Performing Artists</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're a musician, dancer, or live performer, your makeup needs to work just as hard as you do.
        Our Performing Artist makeup services are designed for high-energy environments — from bright stage lights
        to long performance hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        We create bold, striking looks that hold up under pressure. Think sweat-proof foundation, long-lasting eyeliner,
        and vivid colors that stand out on stage while still enhancing your natural features.
      </p>
      <h3>Why Artists Choose Us:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stage-tested, long-wearing products</li>
        <li>Makeup tailored to lighting and performance conditions</li>
        <li>Looks that stay put through movement and sweat</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
