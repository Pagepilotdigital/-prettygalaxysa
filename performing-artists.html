                <h2>The Demands of the Stage</h2>
                <p>Whether you’re hitting the stage, stepping in front of a camera, or performing at a live event, your makeup needs to work just as hard as you do. Performing artists sweat under hot lights, face long hours, and move constantly — regular makeup just doesn’t cut it.</p>

                <h2>How Pretty Galaxy SA Keeps You Camera-Ready</h2>

                    <li><strong>Flawless Finish on Camera:</strong> HD-ready application techniques ensure your features are defined and your skin glows, whether you're being filmed or photographed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bold but Balanced:</strong> We highlight your best features without making you feel overdone. From vibrant eyes to sculpted cheekbones, your look will strike the right balance under stage lights.</li>
